## 2. PART 1: THEORETICAL UNDERSTANDING

### 2.1 Short Answer Questions

#### Q1: Differences Between TensorFlow and PyTorch

**TensorFlow Characteristics:**
- Static computation graphs (though TF 2.x supports eager execution)
- Developed by Google with enterprise-grade production support
- Comprehensive deployment ecosystem (Serving, Lite, JS)
- Steeper learning curve for beginners
- Better for production systems at scale

**PyTorch Characteristics:**
- Dynamic computation graphs (define-by-run)
- Developed by Meta, very Pythonic and intuitive
- Excellent for research and rapid prototyping
- Easier debugging with standard Python tools
- Growing production support

**Selection Criteria:**
- **Choose TensorFlow** for: Production deployment, mobile/edge devices, enterprise infrastructure, comprehensive tooling requirements
- **Choose PyTorch** for: Research projects, rapid experimentation, custom architectures, code clarity priority

#### Q2: Jupyter Notebook Use Cases in AI Development

**Use Case 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
Jupyter Notebooks excel at interactive data exploration where scientists can incrementally load datasets, compute statistics, create visualizations, and test hypotheses without rerunning entire scripts. The mix of code, markdown documentation, and inline plots creates a narrative that documents the analytical process.

**Use Case 2 - Educational and Collaborative Development:**
Notebooks serve as ideal teaching platforms combining explanations, executable code snippets, and visualizations in one document. Teams can use them for peer review, experiment documentation, and knowledge sharing. Cell-by-cell execution enables testing individual components independently.

#### Q3: spaCy's Enhancement of NLP Tasks

spaCy provides industrial-strength NLP capabilities including:
- **Intelligent Tokenization:** Handles complex cases like contractions
- **POS Tagging:** Identifies grammatical roles accurately
- **Named Entity Recognition:** Extracts entities automatically
- **Dependency Parsing:** Analyzes grammatical relationships
- **Pre-trained Models:** Ready-to-use models on large corpora

## 4. PART 3: ETHICS & OPTIMIZATION

### 4.1 Ethical Considerations: Bias Analysis

**Identified Biases in MNIST:**

#### 1. Distribution Bias
- **Issue:** Class imbalance where some digits have fewer samples
- **Impact:** Model biased toward overrepresented digits
- **Mitigation:** Stratified sampling, SMOTE, class weights

#### 2. Representation Bias
- **Issue:** Training data from limited sources (US postal service)
- **Impact:** Poor generalization to diverse handwriting styles
- **Mitigation:** Augment with EMNIST, IAM, international datasets

#### 3. Demographic Bias
- **Issue:** Training on specific age/demographic groups
- **Impact:** Performance varies across populations
- **Mitigation:** Diverse demographic representation, fairness audits

#### 4. Temporal Bias
- **Issue:** MNIST from 1990s; handwriting styles evolving
- **Impact:** Poor performance on modern/digital handwriting
- **Mitigation:** Regular retraining with contemporary data

**Class Distribution Analysis:**

| Digit | Train Count | Train % | Test Count | Test % |
|-------|-------------|---------|------------|--------|
| 0 | 5923 | 9.87% | 980 | 9.80% |
| 1 | 6742 | 11.24% | 1135 | 11.35% |
| 2 | 5958 | 9.93% | 1032 | 10.32% |
| 3 | 6131 | 10.22% | 1010 | 10.10% |
| 4 | 5842 | 9.74% | 982 | 9.82% |
| 5 | 5421 | 9.04% | 892 | 8.92% |
| 6 | 5918 | 9.87% | 958 | 9.58% |
| 7 | 6265 | 10.44% | 1028 | 10.28% |
| 8 | 5851 | 9.75% | 974 | 9.74% |
| 9 | 5949 | 9.91% | 1009 | 10.09% |

**Conclusion:** Dataset is relatively balanced (imbalance ratio: 1.24x)

### 4.2 Bias Mitigation Strategies

**Data-Level Mitigations:**
- Use stratified k-fold cross-validation
- Apply data augmentation (rotation, scaling, elastic deformation)
- Combine multiple datasets (EMNIST, IAM, Chars74K)
- Implement SMOTE for class balancing

**Algorithmic Mitigations:**
- TensorFlow Fairness Indicators for subgroup monitoring
- Weighted loss functions emphasizing low-performing classes
- Ensemble methods across demographic groups
- Adversarial debiasing networks

**Monitoring & Evaluation:**
- Per-class accuracy metrics
- Regular fairness audits
- Error analysis by digit and demographic
- User testing with diverse populations

### 4.3 Troubleshooting Challenge: Buggy Code & Fixes

**Bug #1: Wrong Input Shape**
```python
# ❌ WRONG
layers.Dense(128, input_shape=(28, 28))

# ✓ CORRECT
layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28))
layers.Dense(128)
# OR
layers.Dense(128, input_shape=(784,))  # After flattening
```

**Bug #2: Wrong Activation Function**
```python
# ❌ WRONG
layers.Dense(10, activation='sigmoid')  # Binary classification

# ✓ CORRECT
layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')  # Multi-class (10 digits)
```

**Bug #3: Loss-Target Mismatch**
```python
# ❌ WRONG
loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy'  # For integer labels
# But targets are one-hot encoded

# ✓ CORRECT
loss='categorical_crossentropy'  # Matches one-hot encoded targets
```

**Bug #4: Dimension Mismatch**
```python
# ❌ WRONG
X_train shape: (60000, 28, 28)  # 3D array
# But Dense layer expects 2D input

# ✓ CORRECT
X_train = X_train.reshape(-1, 784)  # Flatten to (60000, 784)
```

### 4.4 Model Optimization Techniques Applied

**1. Regularization:**
- Dropout (0.5) to prevent overfitting
- Early stopping monitoring validation loss
- L2 regularization on dense layers

**2. Architecture Optimization:**
